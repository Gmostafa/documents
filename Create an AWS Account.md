Follow these steps to create an AWS (Amazon Web Services) account:

### Step 1: Visit AWS Sign-up Page
Open your browser and go to AWS Sign-up Page
Click on "Create an AWS Account"
### Step 2: Enter Account Information
Root User Email: Use a valid email address (this will be your AWS root account).
AWS Account Name: Choose a name for your AWS account.
Verify Email: Enter the OTP sent to your email.
### Step 3: Set Up a Secure Password
Create a strong password for your root account.
Confirm the password and continue.
### Step 4: Provide Contact Information
Choose "Personal" (for individuals) or "Business" (for companies).
Enter your full name, address, phone number, and other required details.
### Step 5: Payment Information
Enter a valid credit/debit card for billing verification.
AWS may charge a small, refundable amount ($1) to verify your card.
### Step 6: Verify Your Identity
AWS will send a verification code via SMS or voice call.
Enter the received code to confirm your identity.
### Step 7: Select a Support Plan
Choose one of the following plans:
Basic (Free) – Recommended for beginners.
Developer – Paid, with enhanced support.
Business/Enterprise – For organizations with 24/7 support needs.
### Step 8: Sign in to AWS Management Console
Go to the AWS Console: https://aws.amazon.com/console/
Log in using your email and password.
Set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for extra security.
### Step 9: Start Using AWS (Free Tier Available)
Explore the AWS Free Tier to use services for free (e.g., EC2, S3, Lambda).
Set up Billing Alerts to track usage and avoid unexpected charges.
### Important Tips for Security
* Enable MFA for root and IAM users.
* Create IAM users instead of using the root account.
* Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges.
* Use AWS Free Tier for learning and testing.
